**[Manifest Android Interview](https://www.android.skydoves.me/)** is a comprehensive guide designed to enhance your Android development expertise through **108 interview questions with detailed answers, 162 additional practical questions, and 50+ "Pro Tips for Mastery" sections**. The interview questions primarily focus on Android development‚Äîincluding the Framework, UI, Jetpack Libraries, and Business Logic‚Äîas well as Jetpack Compose, covering Fundamentals, Runtime, and UI.

Each question provides in-depth explanations, guiding you through a structured learning path for Android and Jetpack Compose while reinforcing your understanding of key concepts. At the end of every question, you‚Äôll find **practical questions** designed to simulate real interview scenarios, allowing you to refine your problem-solving skills and prepare effectively for technical discussions.

This book includes relevant resources and additional references for those seeking further study beyond its content. Efforts have been made to provide footnotes for key terms as much as possible that may be unfamiliar or complex, ensuring that beginners can easily grasp challenging concepts while deepening their understanding.

The **"Pro Tips for Mastery"** section dives deeper into advanced topics, uncovering internal API structures and offering expert insights to keep senior developers engaged. For mid-level developers, this section serves as a valuable resource for strengthening Android expertise and fostering a more analytical approach to technical challenges.

I hope this book helps you gain new perspectives, sharpen your problem-solving skills, and build a comprehensive understanding of Android development & ecosystems. Whether you're preparing for your next big interview or simply pushing yourself to master Android development, I encourage you to think beyond implementation‚Äîunderstand the why, experiment with different approaches, and continue learning with curiosity and passion.
